## Quick Note

The tyranny of Israel on the Palestinian people is horrifying and heartbreaking. As such, we all
should try our best to support the Palestinians from our position. Consider supporting the Palestinians
by donating to the [Palestinian Red Crescent Society](https://www.palestinercs.org/en/Donation).
